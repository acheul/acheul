Hi! I'm Jang Hyomin.

I'ver started from a social scientist, going after social mobility studies,
then expanded stages to the area of machine learning, on the issues of data representation and resource effective learning,
and currently working on a new era's documentation tool, "Attention", in Acheulean Graph.
